# Linux basics

Linux, as a widely used open-source operating system, offers a plethora of powerful command-line tools that can be utilized to perform various tasks efficiently. Here's an introduction to some of the most important Linux commands, along with code examples in Bash. 
The commands below can be run from the Terminal in RStudio. When you are on a Mac, there is an built-in Terminal available. When on Windows, we recommend to [install Git-for-Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), if not Terminal is avaialble. In RStudio, you can open a terminal under the `Tools` tab, choose `Terminal` -> `New Terminal`.
Every command in Linux can be seen a a function call. Usually commands have additional options, called `flags`. 

## Getting help for a command
To access the documentation for a given Linux command, you can typically use the built-in manual (man) pages or help options that come with most Linux commands. Here are two common ways to access documentation for Linux commands: 

 - Man Pages: Most Linux commands come with a manual (man) page that provides detailed documentation and usage instructions. You can access the man page for a command by typing "man" followed by the command name in the terminal. For example:

```
man ls
```

This will display the manual page for the "ls" command, which you can scroll through using the arrow keys. To exit the man page, simply press "q".

 - Help flag: Many Linux commands also provide a built-in help option that displays usage instructions and other documentation. You can usually access the help option by appending "--help" or "-h" to the command name. For example:

```
git clone --help
```

This will display the help information for the "git clone" command, which provides details on various options and their usage.

Note that not all Linux commands have built-in help options, and some commands may have different conventions for accessing documentation. In such cases, you can refer to online documentation or external resources, such as official command manuals, Linux documentation websites, or online forums and communities where experienced Linux users share knowledge and provide guidance on using specific commands.

The man pages and help options are comprehensive sources of documentation for Linux commands, providing detailed information on command usage, options, and examples.
