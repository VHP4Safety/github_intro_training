# Conventions

This reader has a number of conventions. Below, we indicate the most important ones.

## Code blocks

This is Bash code, that can be run in a terminal or from a Bash script (`.sh`).
```
# Bash
ls -a
```

This is R code, and its output under the code.
```{r}
x <- c(1:10)
x
```

## Block quotes
We enclose code, file_names, sytem variables, commands or other code associated items with `block quotes`

## R Packages
When referring to R packages we use `{package_name}`

## Assignments
These can be recognized with a specific style, where the assinment is enclosed in a text-box. We created this mark-up with a CSS style sheet. See file `style.css` for details.
