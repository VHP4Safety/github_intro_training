# Collaborate on Github

## Collaboration workflow in short
Collaborating on a GitHub code repository is a fundamental aspect of modern software development, enabling teams to work together seamlessly, regardless of location. Here are some steps and code examples to collaborate effectively on GitHub:

There are a few different workflow that you can use to collaborate in github. We will show you one example: `clone->branch->commit->push->pull-request->merge`. This workflow consists of the following steps. Below the workflow, we continue with how the commands would look like, when working from a terminal. You could also combine these commands with working from the GUI in RStudio.

## Workflow for collaboration

Clone the repository: To start collaborating, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

```
# Bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

try this out with the Github [repo that contains the Reader for this course](https://github.com/VHP4Safety/github_intro_training)

 1. Create a new branch: Create a new branch for your changes to isolate them from the main branch. Choose a descriptive name for the branch and create it using the following command:

```
# Bash
git checkout -b <myinitials_mytask>
```

 2. Make changes: Make your desired changes to the codebase, such as adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation, using your preferred code editor. Here: Try to find a typo and correct it. You should be fine. For sure there are sure some typos to be found! Save the file.

 3. Stage and commit changes: Stage and commit your changes locally with descriptive commit messages using the following commands:

```
# Bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

 4. Push changes to the remote repository: Push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub using the following command:

```
# Bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```


 5. Create a pull request: Go to the repository's GitHub page, navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab, and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Choose the appropriate base and compare branches, and provide a descriptive title and comment for your pull request.

 6. Review and merge: Collaborators can review your changes, provide feedback, and approve the pull request. Once approved, the repository owner or an authorized collaborator can merge the changes into the main branch.

 7. Update local repository: After the changes are merged, update your local repository with the latest changes from the main branch using the following commands:

```
# Bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

8. Repeat steps 3-8: Continue collaborating by repeating steps 3-8 for subsequent changes and updates to the repository.

By following these steps and utilizing Git commands, teams can effectively collaborate on GitHub to develop high-quality software together.

## RStudio GUI
Some of the commands above can also be run from the RStudio Git client. In the top right corner of the GUI in the `Git Pane`, you will find some options to `Commmit`, `Pull` and `Push` from the GUI.

```

## Visualize the history of a Github repo
To get an idea on who contributed what, and how the repo was developed, we can create visulizations of the github reopo from a terminal or R. If you are interested in how to visualize the history of github repo, including commits to all the branches etc. Check out [this blog](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/03/guide-to-tidy-git-analysis/). To get (a simple) graphical representation of a github repo run the following command from the terminal.

```
# bash
git log --graph --full-history --all --color         --pretty=format:"%x1b[31m%h%x09%x1b[32m%d%x1b[0m%x20%s"
```

There are also tools that help you visualize the repo's history is a more user friendly way. If you like to learn more, see e.g. [this blogpost](https://livablesoftware.com/tools-to-visualize-the-history-of-a-git-repository/)

The easiest way to visually inspect your repos commit history is by inspecting the `History` in the `Git Pane` of your RStudio GUI. See the image below:
